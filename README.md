# Regression Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Regression.ipynb`) that demonstrates regression analysis using various techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## File Description
- **Regression.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that covers the steps involved in performing regression analysis on a dataset. It includes code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the necessary packages using:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook:
    ```sh
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
   or
    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```
4. Open `Regression.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

### Notebook Contents
The notebook is structured as follows:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the regression analysis and objectives.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Code for loading the dataset and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
4. **Model Building**: Implementation of various regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and others.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the models on the dataset and evaluating their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.
6. **Results Visualization**: Visualizing the predictions and comparing model performance.
7. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential next steps.

## Example
Below is a small snippet of the kind of code you might find in the notebook for loading and preprocessing data:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data
data = data.dropna()  # Drop missing values
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['target']  # Target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
